## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
wine<-read.csv("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv",sep=";",header=T)
#install.packages("class")
#install.packages("gmodels")
library(class)
library(gmodels)

```
```{r}
#1. Check data characteristics. Is there missing data? Prepare the data for analysis.
str(wine)
sum(is.na(wine))
# There is no missing data as we see from the output of sum(is.na(wine))
```
```{r}
# 2. What is the correlation between the attributes other than wine quality?
cor(wine[-12])
```
```{r}
# 3. Graph the frequency distribution of wine quality.
hist(wine$quality,main="Wine Quality",xlab="Quality")
```
```{r}
# 4. Reduce the levels of rating for quality to three levels as high, medium and low.
# .the range function, range(quality) shows the range of quality as 3 to 9. We will allocate levels as explained .low to ratings 3 and 4 , medium to ratings 5,6 and 7, and high to ratings 8 and 9.
wine$quality<-cut(wine$quality,breaks=c(3,5,8,10),labels=c("low","medium","high"),right=FALSE)

```
```{r}
# 5. Normalize the data set.
# We use the following function to normalize data .
Normalize_function <- function(x) {(x - min(x))/(max(x) - min(x))}
wine_normalized<- as.data.frame(lapply(wine[-12], Normalize_function))
wine<-data.frame(wine_normalized,wine$quality)
```
```{r}
# 6. Divide the data to training and testing groups.
train_index <- sample(nrow(wine), floor(nrow(wine)*.7))
train_set<-wine[train_index,]
test_set<-wine[-train_index,]
train_set_new<-train_set[-12]
test_set_new<-test_set[-12]
train_class<-train_set$wine.quality
test_class <- test_set$wine.quality
```
```{r}
# 7. Use the KNN algorithm to predict the quality of wine using its attributes.
wine_knn_prediction <- knn(train = train_set_new, test = test_set_new, cl= train_class, k = 3) 
```
```{r}
# 8. Evaluate the model performance.
CrossTable(x=test_class, y=wine_knn_prediction, prop.chisq=FALSE)
```
